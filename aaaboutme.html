                            <p class="card-text">  If you're curious about my birthday, it is 22/02/2006.
                                    My birthplace is....obviously, at a hospital or health center. Well, it's on an island called Koh Sdach which means
                                    King Island in English. Sadly, there's no king there.
                                    Koh Sdach features a long beach, and the sea is filled with a variety
                                    of fish. The site is excellent for snorkeling or scuba diving,
                                    as the water is clear, and an array of coral can be seen
                                    growing at the bottom of the sea.

                                    According to legend, there once was a king who commanded
                                    an army on the island. Because there was no fresh water,
                                    the king searched everywhere to find some. At last he found
                                    a rock near the sea. Thinking the rock might contain water,
                                    the king drew his sword and split open the rock, releasing
                                    an endless flow of water that local people still use today.
                                    (I'm not lying.) Even if the weather is as hot as hell, the water
                                    won't be running out. Today, rock become a well(not a concrete well).
                                    If you go to see the well, you are going to see some horses'
                                    footprint on the well(rock). You will also see some swrod scar on the
                                    well and we legend beleivers said that it's the scar where the
                                    king slpit up the rock.

                                Koh Sdach is located in the Gulf of Thailand, around 1.5km off
                                the coast of Botum Sakor national park, in the Kiri Sakor district
                                in Koh Kong province, Cambodia. It belongs to a small archipelago
                                of 12 islands, all in relative proximity to each other and to the
                                main land. A fishing community inhabits the island, with people
                                of Khmer, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese descent. The village
                                stretches along the east side of the island; to the west there is
                                a small Khmer run bungalow guesthouse; at the southern end of the
                                island lies a luxurious holiday resort. Koh Sdach has two beaches,
                                one to the south and one westerly facing.

                        I would read manga while listening to music. At night, I would watch
                        anime until the roosters crow, but I can't do this in Liger or else
                        ...-I think you know what I'm thinking. Sometimes, I would go biking
                        around on the island. I live close to the beach, so sometimes, I would
                        biking for swimming with the little fishes that I'm scared of (the most?).
                        I also have a one year old baby brother. When mom is busy, sometimes, I would
                        just babysit him. Jeff says that he really like to baby Henry because he can
                        spend time with his son. It's true that you got to spend time with your son or brother
                        , but I don't really like babysitting. I feeling it's killing me and that's reminds me of
                        my mom and how tired she must be. Anyway, I don't hate my brother. I love him. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">How do I say this? My hobby at school? Assignments? In my freetimes,
                                I would do laundry as fast as passible or else I don't have anymore time
                                to get my clothes washed. As juniors, we wash our clothes...traditionally?
                                We don't have a machine like senior and when we ask why, people were like
                                "That's a part of your life. Nothing is always easy"...blah and blah.
                                One thing that we never miss is assigments. In the first few weeks of school,
                                there's only one or two, but as days go on, we got more and more. It's rarely
                                me to have nothing to do at all in liger. When that time comes, I call home
                                and see how's eveybody doing. Then, I would read comic online or watch anime
                                on different website. On the weekend, our housemate would sit and watch TV
                                together and it was the happiest time (although not as happy as watching anime).
                                That's how I spend my life at school.</p>
